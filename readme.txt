1) To install this class you must first manually CREATE a database. This is done (locally) by going
   into your mySQL terminal window and using the SQL "CREATE DATABASE [database_name]".

   If you are using an online host, you'll have to go into its control panel (eg C-panel) and create a database.

2) Make sure a database user has complete access to the database in question (SELECT, UPDATE, CREATE, DELETE)

3) Edit the file "database.php" and fill in your database information

4) Navigate to the file "install.php"

5) Navigate to the file "example.php" to test out the class!!
